Final Project Documentation

Discovery:
This project will require a model for the temperature, rpm, electrical charge, oil pressure, speed, odometer, trip meter, gear, fuel.

I will need a root controller, with the capability of swapping out views at will.  

Documented Work:
Putting together so many widgets is proving to be a pain.  The RPM for the engine seems like it should be the driving force for the other controllers.  

I definitely have to put together a model object base class that can be used by the meters in the instrument panel.  The base view controller should be a singleton because several of the model objects need to be able to check on the status of it (for telling whether the car is on, for instance).  

After beginning my work, I realized that I needed to build a few extra classes.  a MeterManager, to handle the updates to the various meters.  This allows the actual car controller to deal with the displaying of the meters, rather than managing the interactions between the objects.  

I also needed to add in a gearbox, to deal with changes to meters which relate to the state of the engine itself.
